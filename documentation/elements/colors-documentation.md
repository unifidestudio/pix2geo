### Theme Colors

Vuero uses predefined SCSS color variables that you can use or customize
before the Sass compilation. SCSS variables are very helpful, as you only
need to change the variable value to be able to change a color accross
the hole theme. Also, please note that `$accent` variable
is never directly used. It acts as counterpart of the `$primary` color
when you turn the dark mode on.
